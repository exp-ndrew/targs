## what

* a tagging system
* *#[selfdogfood](http://indiewebcamp.com/selfdogfood), #[onethingwell](http://onethingwell.org/)*
* a building block of an experiment I'm working on

## plans

* run visualization on top of this system to see connected elements
* run UI framework on top of this system to allow interaction through a GUI
